# Themed Situational Awareness
An extension of the Esri situational awareness widget that lets you group tabs in to themes.

This widget lets you group tabs created in the situational awareness widget in to themes. This then allows you to quickly filter the returned tabs based on the themes you have created.

This widget was built on the 2.11 versions of Esri's Web AppBuilder. You will need the developer edition of Web AppBuilder or have an implementation of ArcGIS Enterprise 10.7 to use this widget.
